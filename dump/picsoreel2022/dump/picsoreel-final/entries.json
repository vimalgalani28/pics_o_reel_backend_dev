It housed all the subsequent viceroys and governors-general of India. It occupies Observatory Hill, one of the seven hills that Shimla is built upon. \r\nThe building was designed by Henry Irwin, an architect in the Public Works Department. The Viceregal Lodge had electricity as early as 1888, much before the rest of the town of Shimla. The building also was equipped with a sophisticated firefighting mechanism through wax-tipped water ducts.\r\nMany historic decisions were taken in the building during the Indian independence movement. The Simla Conference, to discuss self-rule for India, was held here in 1945. The decision to carve out Pakistan and East Pakistan from India was also taken here in 1947.\r\nAfter India gained independence, the building was renamed as Rashtrapati Niwas and was used as a summer retreat for the president of India. However, due to its neglect, Dr. S Radhakrishnan decided to turn it into a centre of higher learning. The summer retreat of the president was shifted from here to a building known as \"The Retreat\" situated in Chharabra, on the outskirts of Shimla.\r\nThe Institute of Advance Studies was the first electrified building in Shimla. This electricity was produced by steam engines which were brought from Britain.\r\n#ShotOniPhone\r\n","imageBucketLink":"https://pics-o-reel.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/62078fe6b4cde24db7884eae_Photography_1.jpeg","imageThumbLink":"https://pics-o-reel.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/62078fe6b4cde24db7884eae_Photography_1_thumb.jpeg","owner":{"$oid":"62078fe6b4cde24db7884eae"},"ownerName":"10530_Shantanu_21-22","ownerPhone":"9403188220","section":"Photography","voteCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1644663783888"}},"updatedAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1644663783888"}},"__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Solang Valley is a beautiful Side Valley of the Kullu Valley in Himachal Pradesh, bounded by the breath-taking view of snowclad mountain-peaks. It has giant slopes of green lawn in the lower part of the valley and snowy terrain on the higher part. It is covered with snow for a fairly large part of the year, where skiing is a popular recreational activity but it melts during the summer months starting May and skiing is then replaced by zorbing (a giant ball with room for 2 people which is rolled down a 200-metre hill), paragliding, parachuting and horse riding. When Paragliding over the mountains, one can see the valley beneath along with the tall forests, which a mesmerizing experience, one that I personally can never forget. The cold air rushing past you, that feeling of flying like a bird while taking in the view that it offers is unparalleled.

This form of art first originated in Maharashtra and has been admired by artists to this date. This painting is created using special paint made from a mixture of rice flour and water, with gum as a binder. As we can see in the painting, it is a bright sunny morning, and all the villagers are doing their daily chores. Just like any other day, we can see women carrying water pots and bathing their children. All the aspects of the painting showcase life in a village, from bullock cart rides to living in huts. The coconut tree gives shade to the people, and the well quenches their thirst. It's a whole different experience to live in such a place and find joy in the smallest of things.","imageBucketLink":"https://pics-o-reel.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/620c9f3fb4cde24db7885468_Painting_1.jpeg","imageThumbLink":"https://pics-o-reel.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/620c9f3fb4cde24db7885468_Painting_1_thumb.jpeg","owner":{"$oid":"620c9f3fb4cde24db7885468"},"ownerName":"41439_Khushi_21_22","ownerPhone":"9764573625","section":"Painting","voteCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1644996952289"}},"updatedAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1644996952289"}},"__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}
